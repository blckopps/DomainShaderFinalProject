# Nature-sLullaby
Nature's Lullaby is a demo made for the completion ceremony of Real Time Rendering 2018 Batch by Domain Group. It is created in OpenGL's Programmable Pipeline, with native windowing on Windows platform and OpenAL for audio. The Central focus of the demo was to Capture scenic beauty of nature and to express it with music. Music has been given a special status for this demo. Basically, one may call music as the Protagonist of this demo, because almost everything in the demo is synchronized with transitions in music.  The scene opens with a Sun rise (Atmospheric Scattering) and Terrain, Grass , flowers are visible. We can notice the change in color on artifacts which emulate color of sunlight falling on objects (Directional Lights).  The same is also done to emulate moon light during night. Camera rotates towards the rest of the terrain and we can see a small field of grass and flowers, with it we see some Sun flowers which are facing the sun. The camera goes closer to the Sun Flower. When SunFlowers are completely bloomed, we see a honey bee hovering over one SunFlower. After this camera slowly goes towards a swarm of butterflies, which can be a visual treat.  Camera Slowly goes back to Honey Bee and follows it towards the lake. As we went towards the lake we came across a few palm trees and grass. The Camera settles at the edge of the lake, where we can see a few lotus pods. Honey Bee dives into a lotus pod and is stuck there till dawn.  After Honey Bee dives into a lotus pod, the Sun sets and the Night scene begins. As soon as the Night Scene begins we see Fireflies and reflection of the whole scene on water is a visual treat.  At dawn Fireflies vanish and Honey Bee leaves the Lotus Pod.  Here the demo Ends.
